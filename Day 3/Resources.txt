Array
for eg. a=10, a=20, a=30
every time have to overwrite the value
to store more than one value/Multiple value's

(data structure) Array is finite ordered and collection of similar type of data elements

finite : fixed in size (Static linear data structure)
ordered : arryas data are store orederly 
homogenoous : only one type of data is stored;
